## Project Overview

This is a simple demo web application that allows users to explore various liquors and view the drinks that can be made with each. 
The site leverages **The Cocktail DB API** to provide sample data and showcases basic functionality, but it can be easily expanded to support:  
- Additional languages  
- A wider range of liquors and drink options
